## Prerequisits
Extensive documentation on how to install and get started with React Native can be found in the official [docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). Depending on what OS you're developing on and what target OS you have in mind, you need to install different stuff.

The quickest way to get up and running is a Mac OS X Setup with iOS. On Windows and Linux only Android development is available. For these setup guides, please refer to the docs.

TL;DR: To run React Native projects you need four things:

1. Install Node: `brew install node`
2. Install watchman: `brew install watchman`
3. Install React Native CLI: `npm install -g react-native-cli`
4. Install XCode: [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (the easy way)

##Â Setup
1. Fork this Repository on GitHub
2. Clone your Fork
3. Install Node dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run React Native Packager: `npm run start`
5. Run App in Emulator: `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`
